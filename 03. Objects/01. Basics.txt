//Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

//If you have properties, highly related with each other, then 
//they can be encapsulated in an object

//The value inside Object Literal can be of any types. May be 
// Number, string , another object, array , function.

//Quite often we have some functions needed to operate these variables
//These may be put inside the object iteslf and called as method

//Function inside an Object is called Method.

//syntax of object

let objectName = { //{} are known as object literal
	key1 : value1,
	key2 : 'value2',
	key3 : function (){
	
	},
	key4 : {
		keyn1 : valuen1,
		keyn2 : valuen2
	}
};

// Lets look at a example 

// Lets take a look at a Circle,
// It has radius, and a position among many properties


let circle = {
	radius : 5,
	
	position : {
		x :1,
		y:1
	},
	
	isVisible: true,
	
	draw : function() {
	
	},
	
	move : function() {
	
	}
};

circle.draw (); //this will call draw method
circle.move (); //this will call move method


//This was a way to create Objects using Object Literal Syntax.
