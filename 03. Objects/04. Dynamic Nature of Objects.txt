// In JavaScript Objects are dynamic.
// Once you create an object you can always add or remove
// methods and properties to them.

//lets take an object 'circle'

const circle = {
	radius : 1
};

console.log(circle);
//It has only property 'radius'
//lets add a property

circle.color = 'yellow';
console.log(circle);

//Now we can see it has a new property 'color'

circle.draw = function() {
	console.log('This method drew a circle.')
}

console.log(circle);
//Now 'circle' object has a new method 'draw'

//lets call the method 
circle.draw();

//Now we have new output in console , called from 'draw' method.

//Now lets delete some 

delete circle.color;
delete circle.draw;
console.log(circle);

//Now the circle object has a single property 

//Something you might have noticed is 'circle' object is a constant
//So how are we able to change this around?
//This is possible because although 'circle' object is constant
//The objects and properties inside are not , they can be assigned or deleted
//But you can not assign a new value to 'circle' object itself .
//Lets see :

// circle = {};

//As i have assigned a new value , there must be an error message in the console
//With an error 'TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.' like this.
//Uncomment and run to see it live.
