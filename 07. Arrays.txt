//Arrays

let selectedColors= [] //initialized an empty array

selectedColors= ['red','yellow']

consle.log(selectedColors);

Array Starts from 0 in JS.

//To read first array value

console.log(selectedColors[0])



//To add other values
//Objects in array and size of arrays are dynamic which means you can add values of different data types as you need.

selectedColors[2]='green' //adding value as we need
selectedColors[3]= 9 //adding integer value 

Arrays are also an object.

typeof selectedColors
> "object"

Predefined objects like Arrays, Strings have predefined properties, one of them is length.

console.log(selectedColors.length)
> 4

So, Array is an datastructure that is used to represent list of items.
