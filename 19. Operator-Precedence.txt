let x = 2 + 3 * 4;

console.log(x);
> 14

//This is because * operator has higher precedence than + , so product of 3
//and 4 is added to 2.

//Using Parenthesis we can change Operator precedence.

// Lets look at the same example but with Parenthesis used.

let x = (2 + 3) * 4;

console.log(x);
> 20

// Here result is different because now 2+3 has higher precedence
