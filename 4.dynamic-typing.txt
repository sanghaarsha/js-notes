JavaScript is a dynamic language.
That means type of variable can be changed at runtime.


> let age = 30;
> typeof age
<-"number"

> let age = 30.59;
> typeof age
<- "number"

it's still a number. JS doesn't have types of number like float & int.

> let name="abc";
> typeof name
<-"string"

> let name=5;
> typeof name
<-"number"

Here, we see type of name is changed to number.
This is dynamic typing.
