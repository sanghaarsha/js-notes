let x = 10;
let y = 3;

//Arithmetic Operators

let sum = x+y;  //Addition
let sub = x-y;  //Subtraction
let mul = x*y;  //Multiplication
let div = x/y;  //Divison
let mod = x%y;  //Modulo (returns remainder)
let exp = x**y; //Exponentiation (raises to the power i.e x^y)
 
console.log(exp);

//We also have Increament and Decreament operators

//Increment (++)
//Two ways of using it (++x,x++)

console.log(++x) //This increases the value of x by and logs to console
console.log(x++) //This logs the value of x in console and increases it by 1
console.log(x)   // Now we can see the increased value from x++

//Decrement
//Two ways of using it (--x,x--)

//Works similar to Increament except decreases value by 1.
