From ES6 it's best to use 'let' instead of 'var' for declaring variables.

let name = 'sangh';
console.log(name)

Rules:

1. Can't use reserved Keywords
2. Use Meaningful Variables Name
3. Can't start with number
4. Can't use hyphens and or space
5. Use variable in Camle-cased ie. firstName, lastName
6. Variables are case sensitive

Best way to declare variable is:

let firstName = 'abc';
let lastName = 'def';

not : let firstName = 'abc',lastName = 'def';
