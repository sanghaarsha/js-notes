// What is 'this'?
// this keyword is used to refernce the object that us is executing the current function

// a function that is part of an object is called 'method'
// if 'this' is in the method it references the object itself (method => object)
// if 'this' is in the regular function it references to global object (function => window (browsers), global (node))

// Lets see an example :

const movie = {
    title: "Mission Impossible",
    play() {
        console.log(this);
    },
};

movie.play();

// Here this is referncing to the object movie itself

// We can also add an method later in movie object and get the same result
// Lets create a stop method to movie which will do same as play method

movie.stop = function () {
    console.log(this);
};

// Here stop is the method in the video object
movie.stop();

// That was for the this used inside  method
// Now lets look at this used for a regular function

function resumeVideo(){
    console.log(this);
}

resumeVideo();

// We san see global object being logged into the console in node and Window object in browser
