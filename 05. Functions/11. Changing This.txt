// Using self/that
// some developers prefer to use that, some prefer self

// In previous lesson, we passed this argument in forEach as a parameter
// To solve the problem of this pointing to the global object
// But we can use another way

const myMovies = {
    name: "The Godfather",
    tags: ["action", "high ratings", "mafia"],
    showTags() {
        const that = this;
        this.tags.forEach(function (tag) {
            console.log(that.name, tag);
        });
    },
};

myMovies.showTags();

// What we did was, we set 'that' to reference to the myMovies object
// and that solves the problem araised by this inside the callback function
// It's not a preferred approach, but many developers use it.

// So, Lets look at the another approach
// using call/apply/bind to set 'this' argument for a given function
