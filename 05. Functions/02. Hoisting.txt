// Key difference between Function Declarations and Function Expression is
// You can call a function defined by Function Declaration before it's defined
// You can't do the same for Function Expression

// For the functions defined by Function Declarations 
// JavaScript engine moves the function code to 
// the top then the function call internally
// This process is called 'Hoisting'
// Process of moving function declarations on top of 
// The file done internally by the JavaScript engine 
// Is called Hoisting.
