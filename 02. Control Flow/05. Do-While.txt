//Program to display Odd numbers in between 1 to 10

let i = 0;

do{
	if (i%2 !== 0)
	console.log(i);

while(i<=10);

//In this loop condition is checked after the first iteration

//So lets check if thats the case.

//Lets use decrement operator to solve the same problem
//But a little bit modified
//As i is an global variable and already used 
//lets use another variable x

let x = 11;

do{
        if (x%2 !== 0)

while(x<=10 && x>0);

//If we run the program we will get 11 as the output
//But condition says number must be less than 10.
//Which is because of the first iteration done before
//checking the condition.
