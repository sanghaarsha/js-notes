//Infinite Loops are the loops which runs forever
//some examples of infinite loops are:

let i = 0;
while (i<5){
	console.log(i);
}

//Above program has an end condition but misses the increment


while(true){

}

while(1){

}

do{

} while(true);


for(let i=0;i>=0;i++){

}

//Above programs do not have end conditions
