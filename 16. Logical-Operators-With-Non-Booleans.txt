//Result of Logical Operators is not neccessarily true or false,
// it may also be
an non-boolean value.

console.log(true || false);
> true

console.log('Hello' || false);
> Hello

console.log(1 || false);
> 1


//So what happens here is JavaScript engine looks at each operands. If one of 
//the operands is not true/false, it tries to interpret it as Truthy/Falsy.

// Falsy(It's not the boolean false but falsy), some of the falsy values are:

	// undefined
	// null
	// 0
	// false
	// ''
	// NaN

//Anything that is not falsy is Truthy

//Lets look at the example :

currentColor =''; // '' is a falsy
userColor='Red';

console.log(userColor || currentColor);
>Red

//What if a Condition is like this :

console.log(false || 1 || 2);
> 1

//No matter how many conditions are there once JS engine finds a 
//True or a Truthy value it returns it. This is called Short-Circuiting.


//So when it's used in Real World?
//It's used to set a Default value in Program.
//We have a Default value which is Selected if User given Value is null.

//Let's look at modified example from above:

//When userColor is null

defaultColor ='Red'; // '' is a falsy
userColor='';

console.log(userColor || defaultColor);
>Red

//When User color is Yellow

defaultColor ='Red'; //Truthy
userColor='Yellow'; // Truthy

console.log(userColor || defaultColor);
> Yellow

//So here if user selects a color that color is selected else defaultColor is selected. As First Truthy is returned by Default.
